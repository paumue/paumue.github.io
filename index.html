  <b>Hi there! This is my wobsite.</b></br>

  <p>My name is Paul. I code, build products and sometimes consult. I am an avid reader but definitely not a <del>frontend dev</del>.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, I read, learn and build stuff to solve two challenges I deeply care about:</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">
    <ul>
      <li>Education isn't working anymore. Currently education focuses more on the institutions than on the individuals themselves. The technology we built is not helping us to learn better, but rather it is addictive and hinders learning. Learners are put into boxes and made to learn in specific frameworks. We need to build an affordable, technology-powered education system with the learners’s needs at the core.</li>
      <li>The internet is broken. We don't have data ownership and people are not incentivised to create great content since only big tech profits. We need to build a privacy-first internet where users have absolute data ownership and content creators can monetise their work.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>If you feel passionate about theses challenges too, get in touch!</p>

  <b>Background</b>

  <p>Currently, I am a BSc Computer Science student at King's College London. I worked as a German & Computer Science teacher at an international school in Lithuania for a year, got some experience doing software engineering in a MedTech start-up in Austria and data science at a marketing agency in London.</p>

  <p>Then my interests shifted more towards the business side of things. For a summer, I consulted big corporates in Zurich on how to use blockchain and I was a summer analyst at a big consultancy’s digital lab in London, doing tech consulting focused on digital transformation projects.</p>

  <p>During my degree, I worked as the head of data & analytics for a global, student-run, non-profit start-up, building data pipelines and working on a data culture. I then co-founded a tutoring initiative in Austria to support students impacted by Covid-19. After scaling it to 1000+ users, I moved on to our newest venture called Menon Labs. We are building a learning platform that combines the advantages of online education and traditional offline institutions. </p>

  <p>Academically, I spent a few weeks learning about machine intelligence at Shanghai Jiao Tong university and I am a teaching assistant for database systems. Moreover, I am a research assistant at KCL's department of digital humanities, researching and mapping the developement of the digital silk road.</p>

  <p>I know some Python (mostly pandas and the other packages you need, to have fun with data), Java and JS (mostly node.js). I also used C++ and Scala for a little bit.</p>
